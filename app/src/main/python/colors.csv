1.TYPE OF SOIL: Sandy Soil
Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely
divided rock and mineral particles. A soil containing more than 85% sand-sized
particles by mass is called sandy.Sandy soil requires organic amendments such as
glacial rock dust, green sand, kelp meal, or other organic fertilizer blends.
Sandy soils are formed from rock such as shale, granite quartz and limestone.

GREAT FOR:
Carrots, Radishes, Potatoes, Lettuce, Collard greens, Tomatoes, Zucchini,
Corn, Asparagus, Watermelon, Beans, and Cucumber.

2.TYPE OF SOIL: Loamy Soil
A relatively even mix of sand, silt and clay, feels fine-textured and
slightly damp. It has ideal characteristics for gardening, lawns and shrubs. Loamy
soil has great structure, adequate drainage, is moisture retaining, full of nutrients,
easily cultivated and it warms up quickly in spring, but doesn't dry out quickly in
summer. Loamy soils require replenishing with organic matter regularly, and tend to be acidic.

4.TYPE OF SOIL: Sandy Soil
Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely
divided rock and mineral particles. A soil containing more than 85% sand-sized
particles by mass is called sandy.Sandy soil requires organic amendments such as
glacial rock dust, green sand, kelp meal, or other organic fertilizer blends.
Sandy soils are formed from rock such as shale, granite quartz and limestone.

GREAT FOR:
Carrots, Radishes, Potatoes, Lettuce, Collard greens, Tomatoes, Zucchini,
Corn, Asparagus, Watermelon, Beans, and Cucumber.

1.TYPE OF SOIL: Loamy Soil
A relatively even mix of sand, silt and clay, feels fine-textured and
slightly damp. It has ideal characteristics for gardening, lawns and shrubs. Loamy
soil has great structure, adequate drainage, is moisture retaining, full of nutrients,
easily cultivated and it warms up quickly in spring, but doesn't dry out quickly in
summer. Loamy soils require replenishing with organic matter regularly, and tend to be acidic.

GREAT FOR:
Beans & Peas,Okra,Eggplant,Tomato,Dragon Fruit,Prickly Pear,Pomegranate and Fig.

SOIL STATUS FOR LOAM SOIL:  FERTILE
---------------------------------------------------------------
2.TYPE OF SOIL: Peaty Soil
A darker soil and feels damp and spongy due to its higher levels of peat.
It is an acidic soil which slows down decomposition and leads to the soil having
fewer nutrients.The main minerals found in the peat soil are clay minerals
(illite, chlorite and kaolinite) and gravel soil minerals(quartz, plagioclase and mica).

GREAT FOR:
Potatoes, Sugar beet, celery, Onions, Carrots, Lettuce and Market garden crops.

SOIL STATUS FOR PEAT SOIL:  FERTILE
--------------------------------------------------------------
3.TYPE OF SOIL:  Clay Soil
Feels lumpy and is sticky when wet and rock hard when dry. Clay soil is
poor at draining and has few air spaces.Clay minerals are composed essentially
of silica, alumina or magnesia or both, and water, but iron substitutes for
aluminum and magnesium in varying degrees, and appreciable quantities of potassium,
sodium, and calcium are frequently present as well.

Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Cabbage (red and green), Cabbage (Napa and savoy),
Cauliflower, Kale, Bean, Pea, Potato and Daikon radish.

2.TYPE OF SOIL: Sandy Soil
Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely
divided rock and mineral particles. A soil containing more than 85% sand-sized
particles by mass is called sandy.Sandy soil requires organic amendments such as
glacial rock dust, green sand, kelp meal, or other organic fertilizer blends.
Sandy soils are formed from rock such as shale, granite quartz and limestone.

GREAT FOR:
Carrots, Radishes, Potatoes, Lettuce, Collard greens, Tomatoes, Zucchini,
Corn, Asparagus, Watermelon, Beans, and Cucumber.

SOIL STATUS FOR SANDY SOIL:  DRY
------------------------------------------------------------
3.TYPE OF SOIL: Peaty Soil
A darker soil and feels damp and spongy due to its higher levels of peat.
It is an acidic soil which slows down decomposition and leads to the soil having
fewer nutrients.The main minerals found in the peat soil are clay minerals
(illite, chlorite and kaolinite) and gravel soil minerals(quartz, plagioclase and mica).

GREAT FOR:
Potatoes, Sugar beet, celery, Onions, Carrots, Lettuce and Market garden crops.

1.TYPE OF SOIL:  Loamy Soil
A relatively even mix of sand, silt and clay, feels fine-textured and
slightly damp. It has ideal characteristics for gardening, lawns and shrubs. Loamy
soil has great structure, adequate drainage, is moisture retaining, full of nutrients,
easily cultivated and it warms up quickly in spring, but doesn't dry out quickly in
summer. Loamy soils require replenishing with organic matter regularly, and tend to be acidic.

GREAT FOR:

1.TYPE OF SOIL:  Loamy Soil
A relatively even mix of sand, silt and clay, feels fine-textured and
slightly damp. It has ideal characteristics for gardening, lawns and shrubs. Loamy
soil has great structure, adequate drainage, is moisture retaining, full of nutrients,
easily cultivated and it warms up quickly in spring, but doesn't dry out quickly in
summer. Loamy soils require replenishing with organic matter regularly, and tend to be acidic.

GREAT FOR:
Beans & Peas,Okra,Eggplant,Tomato,Dragon Fruit,Prickly Pear,Pomegranate and Fig.

-------------------------------------------------------------
2.TYPE OF SOIL:  Sandy Soil
Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely
divided rock and mineral particles. A soil containing more than 85% sand-sized
particles by mass is called sandy.Sandy soil requires organic amendments such as
glacial rock dust, green sand, kelp meal, or other organic fertilizer blends.
Sandy soils are formed from rock such as shale, granite quartz and limestone.

GREAT FOR:
Carrots, Radishes, Potatoes, Lettuce, Collard greens, Tomatoes, Zucchini,
Corn, Asparagus, Watermelon, Beans, and Cucumber.

soil has great structure, adequate drainage, is moisture retaining, full of nutrients,
easily cultivated and it warms up quickly in spring, but doesn't dry out quickly in
summer. Loamy soils require replenishing with organic matter regularly, and tend to be acidic.

1.TYPE OF SOIL: Sandy Soil
Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely
divided rock and mineral particles. A soil containing more than 85% sand-sized
particles by mass is called sandy.Sandy soil requires organic amendments such as
glacial rock dust, green sand, kelp meal, or other organic fertilizer blends.
Sandy soils are formed from rock such as shale, granite quartz and limestone.

2.TYPE OF SOIL: Clay soil
Feels lumpy and is sticky when wet and rock hard when dry. Clay soil is
poor at draining and has few air spaces.Clay minerals are composed essentially
of silica, alumina or magnesia or both, and water, but iron substitutes for
aluminum and magnesium in varying degrees, and appreciable quantities of potassium,
sodium, and calcium are frequently present as well.
